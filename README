Firmware for the Motor Controller developed in-house
by Berkeley Pioneers in Engineering.

-- "/piemotorcontroller": Basic firmware for the 
   motor controller written in AVR C and utilizing the
   Wire library from Arduino.

-- "/piemotorledblinker": Firmware written in AVR C 
   which blinks the status LEDs to confirm that the 
   microcontroller is working.

-- "/i2ctester": Firmware to running on an Arduino 
   which translates commands sent via the serial port
   to I2C messages for the purpose of sending test 
   commands to the motor controller.

-- "/spitester": Firmware to run on an Arduino which 
   translates commands sent via the serial port to 
   SPI data for the purpose of sending test commands.
   Not used for the motor controller, but may be 
   useful for testing some SPI sensors in the future.
