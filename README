Firmware for the Motor Controller developed in-house
by Berkeley Pioneers in Engineering.

The following projects can be opened with the 
Arduino IDE available at www.arduino.cc

-- "/piemotorcontroller": Basic firmware for the 
   motor controller.

-- "/piemotorledblinker": Firmware which blinks the 
   status LEDs to confirm that the microcontroller is
   working.

-- "/i2ctester": Firmware running on another Arduino 
   which translates commands sent via the serial port
   to I2C messages for the purpose of sending test 
   commands to the motor controller.
